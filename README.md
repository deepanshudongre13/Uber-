🚖 Uber Fare & Traffic Impact Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Uber ride data to understand how traffic conditions impact fares, ride duration, and surge pricing. The analysis helps identify peak demand patterns, optimize pricing strategies, and improve customer experience.

🗂️ Dataset

Source: Provided as part of UpGrad Data Science Certification

Records: ~70,000 ride entries

Features: Pickup time, Drop time, Distance, Traffic intensity, Fare amount, Payment type, etc.

🔧 Tools & Technologies

Python → Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

SQL → Data extraction and query-based analysis

Power BI → Interactive dashboard and visual insights

Excel → Data cleaning and quick summaries

📊 Key Analysis Performed

Data cleaning & preprocessing (handling null values, duplicates, data types).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends.

Analyzed peak hours and traffic impact on fares and trip durations.

Fare distribution by distance, traffic level, and day of week.

Surge pricing patterns under high traffic conditions.

📈 Dashboard Highlights (Power BI)

Ride demand across different hours of the day.

Average fare by traffic intensity.

Trip distribution by distance and location.

Impact of traffic on ride duration and fare variation.

💡 Insights

Fares are significantly higher during peak traffic hours.

Longer trip durations are strongly correlated with heavy traffic.

Surge pricing is most frequent during weekday evenings.

Optimizing route allocation during traffic can improve ride efficiency.
