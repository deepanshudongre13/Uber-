🚖 Uber Fare & Traffic Impact Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project explores Uber ride data to analyze how traffic conditions affect fares and trip durations. Using Python in Jupyter Notebook, the project performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to uncover meaningful insights.

🗂️ Dataset

- Source: Provided as part of UpGrad Data Science Certification
- Records: ~70,000 ride entries
- Key Columns: Pickup time, Drop time, Distance, Traffic intensity, Fare amount, Payment type, etc.

🔧 Tools & Libraries

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

📊 Key Steps in Analysis

Cleaned dataset (removed nulls, duplicates, corrected datatypes).

- Performed EDA to identify usage and fare trends.
- Analyzed peak ride hours and high-demand routes.
- Studied impact of traffic levels on ride duration and fare.
- Visualized fare distribution, surge pricing, and distance vs fare relationships.

💡 Insights

- Fares increase significantly during peak traffic hours.
- Longer ride durations are directly correlated with heavy traffic.
- Surge pricing patterns are highest during weekday evenings.
- Most frequent trips are short-distance rides within city limits.
